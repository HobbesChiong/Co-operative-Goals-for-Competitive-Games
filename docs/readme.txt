# Co-operative-Goals-for-Competitive-Games

Co-operative-Goals-for-Competitive-Games is an android app made with 3 other members in my Software Engineering class where we had to a month to experience a mock scrum setting with 3 iterations. The purpose of the app is to create Co-operative achievements for traditionally competitive games. Users can take a picture of their board game and upload scores from their previous games and with our self made algorithim each playthrough results in an achievment granted to the users. Some features of the app are saved game history, statisitics on achievements and ability to save photos of your games.
